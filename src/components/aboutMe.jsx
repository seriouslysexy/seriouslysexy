	<Typography>
		I'm a software engineer currently based in central Florida. I love learning and solving technical problems.
		I discovered my passion for working on computers in my childhood when I was desperate to remove a virus from my family's home computer before my mom found out.
		Thankfully, I've come a long way since then. I repaired computers and phones through high school until I got an IT job at 17.
		From there, I worked out of IT to frontend development and eventually to backend development in NodeJS.
		My current focus is development and maintenance of many of our server-side applications at ALTR.
